# Tata Retail Time Series Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the *Tata Retail Time Series Analysis* project. This project focuses on deriving meaningful insights from a large-scale dataset of Tata Retail's online customer orders. By performing various advanced analytics techniques, the project helps in understanding customer behavior, segmentation, and churn trends.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Scale**: Analysis conducted on a dataset containing 500,000+ customer order records.
- **Objective**: To uncover actionable insights for improving customer retention and segmentation strategies.
- **Approach**: Time series analysis combined with customer analytics methods like RFM analysis and churn prediction.

## Features

- **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis**: Identified high-value customers based on purchase behavior.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouped customers into meaningful clusters to tailor marketing strategies.
- **Churn Prediction**: Detected potential customer drop-offs using historical patterns and behavioral data.
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive and insightful visualizations for trends, segments, and predictions using Power BI and Matplotlib.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas`, `NumPy` – Data manipulation and numerical operations
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – Data visualization
  - **Power BI** – Dashboard and business intelligence visuals
